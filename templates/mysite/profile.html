  <h2>My Story</h2>
  <p>My name is Njoku Chinasa Enyoka. Like I said, I used to be a structural engineer by training. But that is in the past now. These days, my interest is primarily on building software applications. Most of the time, I use technologies like HTML, CSS, Python, Javascript, Django, and SQL in my projects. I am naturally inclined towards solving problems relating to Finance and Technology. This is especially as they relate to Data Science, Machine Learning and Image Processing.</p><p>I am convinced a conscious implementation of optical character recognition (OCR) and machine learning models would go a long way to improve on our data collection techniques. This would have a significant impact on customer experience, as processing time would reduce during customer on boarding. The cost implication of this initiative would be positive in the long run. A lot of this can also be extended to credit assessment and transaction monitoring in the most economic and efficient way. And I want to be part of the world that would lead such bold initiative, as the financial products continue to deploy Machine Learning models to keep improving overall customer experience.</p><p>I have taken several courses on online learning platforms like Udemy, Coursera and edX. These courses range from topics in Credit and Operational Risk Management, Corporate Finance to macroeconomic topics like ‘Unlocking Finance and Development in Emerging Markets’ organized by the World Bank. I guess my extensive experience in the financial services industry has played a key role in shaping my world view of things. I am an accountant. I love to research. I love to learn.
